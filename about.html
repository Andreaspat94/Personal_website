                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    Born and raised in Heraklion city in Crete. At the age of 18 I left the island and moved to Piraeus for my bachelor's studies in business administration. As a student, I worked as a musician, an occupation that I am still attached to and travelled in Europe (mostly).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working experience in my area of studies showed me that business and economics is not my thing, so I decided to make a fresh start and start coding. After a basic training in web techbologies, I started working as a developer, but I wanted more! That is why I started a master's degree in university of athens on information technology. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Currently, my main objectives are to finish my masters and impove my music skills and knowledge.
