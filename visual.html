                    <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
                    <p>The first project we have for you is an informative graphic named Visualizing the History of Pandemics by Nicholas LePan. It tells the story of all the known pandemics in the history of mankind, including the name of the disease, death toll and the approximate date the pandemic occurred.</p>
                    <p>While the exact number of victims of every disease is still under question, we can still learn from this graphic that super-spreading infections happened across all history of mankind. Statistical data of this infographic shows some diseases scaling with the growth of the population.</p>
                    <p>Striking 3D illustrations of diseases are combined with the research data from CDC, WHO, BBC, Wikipedia, Historical records, Encyclopedia Britannica and John Hopkins University. The illustrations scale according to the recorded death toll to allow scanning and recognizing data easily. </p>
                    <p>I liked this visualization because of its simplicity. 
                        It only contains a few info (e.g name of disease, death toll etc), but it tells you a whole story. 
                        Furthermore, visualizing each virus with different sizes and colors make it even easier to read and understand.</p>
